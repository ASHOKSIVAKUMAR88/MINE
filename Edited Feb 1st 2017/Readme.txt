 Edited server and client code in such a way
	 Client can do Initialise and select resource from the availble resources and do operations like 
		1.Get
		2.Put (A input_string is only modified which is added by me)
		3.Post
		4.Initialisation again		
	Server can do initialise with the available resources (in this case, two resources of same type) and process the requests
		like GET,PUT,POST

Note: Please observe that in the case PUT, A new variable input_string is only modified in the case of PUT selection
