Beacon Advertising with hcitool
After the embedded device is properly configured, the advertising may be started using the hcitool command contained in the bluez packet.
Plug in the Bluetooth dongle if needed and verify that the interface is up with the following command:
sudo hciconfig hci0
If the interface is down, enable it with the following command:
sudo hciconfig hci0 up
To configure the advertising packet, enter the following command:
sudo hcitool -i hci0 cmd 0x08 0x0008 1e 02 01 1a 1a ff 4c 00 02 15 aa aa aa aa bb bb cc cc dd dd ee ee ee ee ee ee 01 00 01 00 c5
In this example, the packet will contain the uuid aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-eeeeeeeeeeee, major 1, minor 1 and Tx Power -59 dBm.
For further information about BLE commands and packet formats, refer to the Bluetooth 4.0 Core specifications
To set the advertising interval to 1 second, enter the following command:
sudo hcitool -i hci0 cmd 0x08 0x0006 a0 00 a0 00 03 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 07 00
Finally, to start the advertising, enter the following command: sudo hcitool -i hci0 cmd 0x08 0x000a 01 To verify that the embedded device is broadcasting its beacon, use a smartphone with a iBeacon scanner app (e.g., iBeacon Finder, iBeacon Scanner, or iBeaconDetector on Android).
To stop the advertising, write 0 to the register 0x000a as shown in the following command:
sudo hcitool -i hci0 cmd 0x08 0x000a 00
